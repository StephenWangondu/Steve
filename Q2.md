Q2.md Difference Between Arrays and Linked Lists // In trems of memory

Arrays use contiguous blocks of memory where elements are stored next to each other in memory while linked list use non-contiguous memory locations where node can be stored anywhere in memory.

Arrays uses static allocation in the memory because In many languages (like Java), arrays have fixed size that must be declared at initialization while linked list uses dynamic allocation in the memory because memory is allocated at runtime as new nodes are added, allowing the list to grow or shrink.

Arrays have less overhead per element since they only store the actual data which is efficency while linked list each node requires extra memory to store the reference to other node.

Arrays have a random access of elements due to contiguous storage, arrays support direct access to any element using an index while in linked list sequential access is required to traversal from the beginning to the end to access elements.

//In trems of perfomance

Arary Resizing is an expensive operation that requires creating a new array and copying elements while linked list Resizing has no explicit resizing needs because they grow or shrink one node at a time.

Arrarys have a better cache performance due to contiguous memory allocation while linked list have poorer cache performance due to scattered memory allocation.

In arrays the access Time is Constant for accessing any element by index while in liknked list the acces time is Linear to access an arbitrary element.

//In trems of insertion and deletion operations

Insertion at beginning in arrys requires shifting all elements to make space while in linked list Insertion at beginning is Constant time operation regardless of list size

In arrays deletion from beginning requires shifting all elements to fill the gaps while in linked list deletion from beginning is Constant time operation.
